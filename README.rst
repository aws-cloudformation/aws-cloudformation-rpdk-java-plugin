AWS CloudFormation Resource Provider Java Plugin
================================================

The CloudFormation CLI (cfn) allows you to author your own resource
providers that can be used by CloudFormation.

This plugin library helps to provide Java runtime bindings for the
execution of your providers by CloudFormation.

Usage
-----

If you are using this package to build resource providers for
CloudFormation, install the (CloudFormation
CLI)[https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/aws-cloudformation-rpdk] and
the (CloudFormation CLI Java
Plugin)[https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/aws-cloudformation-rpdk-java-plugin]

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install cloudformation-cli
   pip install cloudformation-cli-java-plugin

Refer to the documentation for the `CloudFormation CLI`_ for usage
instructions.

Development
-----------

First, you will need to install the (CloudFormation
CLI)[https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/aws-cloudformation-rpdk], as
it is a required dependency:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install cloudformation-cli

For changes to the plugin, a Python virtual environment is recommended.

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   # assuming cloudformation-cli has already been cloned/downloaded
   pip install -e .
   pre-commit install

Linting and running unit tests is done via `pre-commit`_, and so is
performed automatically on commit. The continuous integration also runs
these checks. Manual options are available so you don't have to commit):

.. code-block:: bash

   # run all hooks on all files, mirrors what the CI runs
   pre-commit run --all-files
   # run unit tests only. can also be used for other hooks, e.g. black, flake8, pylint-local
   pre-commit run pytest-local
